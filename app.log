Disappointed as this restaurant is representing the hotel more broadly.","languageCode":"en"},"authorAttribution":{"displayName":"Daniel Stevens","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100197937310163445942/reviews","photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKoEuEns70gylkXDZED78Xpge5VLHdmWZb5xTSPkQqfU8YU86Wq=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo"},"publishTime":"2024-12-07T22:49:00.049030Z","flagContentUri":"https://www.google.com/local/review/rap/report?postId=ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2dU1YTl9BRRAB&d=17924085&t=1","googleMapsUri":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m6!14m5!1m4!2m3!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2dU1YTl9BRRAB!2m1!1s0x8834f159c36e9765:0xcaa7d0feae3b65f9"}]},{"id":"ChIJwX_KfyzxNIgR_ZfJ5n0rFy0","types":["bar","restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"formattedAddress":"Grant St, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA","location":{"latitude":40.440876599999996,"longitude":-79.9954168},"rating":4.7,"userRatingCount":6,"displayName":{"text":"Brew Gentlemen Steel Garden","languageCode":"en"},"delivery":false,"dineIn":true,"servesVegetarianFood":false,"currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":false,"periods":[{"open":{"day":2,"hour":15,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":11}},"close":{"day":2,"hour":19,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":11}}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":15,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":12}},"close":{"day":3,"hour":19,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":12}}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":15,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":13}},"close":{"day":4,"hour":19,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":13}}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":15,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":7}},"close":{"day":5,"hour":19,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":7}}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: Closed","Tuesday: 3:00 – 7:00 PM","Wednesday: 3:00 – 7:00 PM","Thursday: 3:00 – 7:00 PM","Friday: 3:00 – 7:00 PM","Saturday: Closed","Sunday: Closed"],"nextOpenTime":"2025-02-11T20:00:00Z"},"reviews":[{"name":"places/ChIJwX_KfyzxNIgR_ZfJ5n0rFy0/reviews/ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1OF9uZDZ3RRAB","relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 years ago","rating":4,"text":{"text":"Nice little pop up for the area.

From the moment you walk in, you’re greeted by the friendliest worker who makes you feel like family. Their warmth and attentiveness truly enhance the experience.\n\nThe pizza is phenomenal—perfectly crispy crust, flavorful sauce, and toppings that are fresh and generously portioned. You can tell they put care into every pie they make.\n\nWhat’s even better are the amazing deals they offer.

I am very curious if this is the whole downtown as it wasn't the only place that seemed under staffed and not really ready for customers.","languageCode":"en"},"authorAttribution":{"displayName":"Michael Cusden","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117805981239438565141/reviews","photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXDBG72zgIeDuUCtsxKsM26xzaZlcQ2Sd_qFZhALEpIMd4mwj1C1w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5"},"publishTime":"2024-04-30T15:29:47.683993Z","flagContentUri":"https://www.google.com/local/review/rap/report?postId=ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqM0ttbmRBEAE&d=17924085&t=1","googleMapsUri":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m6!14m5!1m4!2m3!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqM0ttbmRBEAE!2m1!1s0x8834f159c1cf9faf:0xfd7e24410a18ac5b"},{"name":"places/ChIJr5_PwVnxNIgRW6wYCkEkfv0/reviews/ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmdXRUYkVnEAE","relativePublishTimeDescription":"a month ago","rating":2,"text":{"text":"We came here for brunch because it was next to our hotel and had a Jamba Juice connected.\n\nThey didn't make my sandwich correctly.

To start with something positive, they're the only coffee shop within a pretty significant radius that's actually open on Sunday mornings, which is a nice convenience. They also offer a decent assortment of bottled and canned beverages.\n\nUnfortunately, though, I haven't had any coffee drinks from this establishment that were better than mediocre. Their cold brew is hollow and bitter. Their espresso is acceptable at best. Flavored lattes are bland and not well balanced. Their staff is also a bit of a mixed bag.

To start with something positive, they're the only coffee shop within a pretty significant radius that's actually open on Sunday mornings, which is a nice convenience. They also offer a decent assortment of bottled and canned beverages.\n\nUnfortunately, though, I haven't had any coffee drinks from this establishment that were better than mediocre. Their cold brew is hollow and bitter. Their espresso is acceptable at best. Flavored lattes are bland and not well balanced. Their staff is also a bit of a mixed bag.

After we tried to continue to stay after the fact it just so happens that he was out of the product that she wanted causing us to leave and not wanting to return.","languageCode":"en"},"authorAttribution":{"displayName":"Precious Mitchell","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109228122822212901695/reviews","photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUeWbXKFRl-LWUG_9m6E-1eYIIJKluGoPFqBj9tG1Lrch9mruOobQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo"},"publishTime":"2025-01-12T16:24:32.983950Z","flagContentUri":"https://www.google.com/local/review/rap/report?postId=ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfdUtDN2lRRRAB&d=17924085&t=1","googleMapsUri":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m6!14m5!1m4!2m3!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfdUtDN2lRRRAB!2m1!1s0x8834f157ead15ad7:0x2cf42f0a331378d3"}]},{"id":"ChIJDwC811bxNIgR7u9WMUuNjto","types":["bakery","cafe","dessert_shop","confectionery","food_store","food","store","point_of_interest","establishment"],"internationalPhoneNumber":"+1 412-456-2727","formattedAddress":"308 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15222, USA","location":{"latitude":40.4398492,"longitude":-80.0004969},"rating":4.8,"websiteUri":"https://lagourmandinebakery.com/","priceLevel":"PRICE_LEVEL_INEXPENSIVE","userRatingCount":440,"displayName":{"text":"La Gourmandine","languageCode":"en"},"takeout":true,"delivery":true,"dineIn":true,"currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":false,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":8,"minute":30,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":9}},"close":{"day":0,"hour":14,"minute":30,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":9}}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":8,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":10}},"close":{"day":1,"hour":17,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":10}}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":8,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":11}},"close":{"day":2,"hour":17,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":11}}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":8,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":12}},"close":{"day":3,"hour":17,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":12}}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":8,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":13}},"close":{"day":4,"hour":17,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":13}}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":8,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":7}},"close":{"day":5,"hour":17,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":7}}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":8,"minute":30,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":8}},"close":{"day":6,"hour":14,"minute":30,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":8}}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Tuesday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Wednesday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Thursday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Friday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Saturday: 8:30 AM – 2:30 PM","Sunday: 8:30 AM – 2:30 PM"],"nextOpenTime":"2025-02-08T13:30:00Z"},"reviews":[{"name":"places/ChIJDwC811bxNIgR7u9WMUuNjto/reviews/ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQeWRyOGl3RRAB","relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","rating":5,"text":{"text":"Our hotel didnt serve breakfast in the morning and one of my friends had searched for some local cafes for us to try and this was one of the recommended spots to visit.

The coffee itself when I got my orders was standard Dunkin' quality, so that was good. If you're staying in the block of hotels near Melon Square, be cautious and hopefully, you don't experience the same issues I experienced at this Dunkin' location.","languageCode":"en"},"authorAttribution":{"displayName":"Peter A.

Usually, one person will taste the wine first not at the same time. Third, the wine glass was dripping with wine since it was not properly poured. also when serving the plates, it should be to the right of the person. Not passing it across the table and etc. lastly, I was missing the broccolini that was supposed to be included. So perhaps a little discussion with the staff about some more detail when serving since this is a fine dining restaurant. We were very polite with the whole staff but here is something to perhaps consider. The food was good, some of the plate presentation needed to be cleaned I believe.

The salmon on the salad was cooked well though, so I appreciate that!","languageCode":"en"},"authorAttribution":{"displayName":"Megan McClintic","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104713064216979732866/reviews","photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKW_HGYmLR8vcyX6sbQW7pxKUZnCrSQ70xVEBG4vmSPqmTtFA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5"},"publishTime":"2024-01-24T01:42:02.278227Z","flagContentUri":"https://www.google.com/local/review/rap/report?postId=ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROdVphclhREAE&d=17924085&t=1","googleMapsUri":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m6!14m5!1m4!2m3!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROdVphclhREAE!2m1!1s0x8834f1577bf7456b:0x9dd5d689a638f46d"},{"name":"places/ChIJa0X3e1fxNIgRbfQ4ponW1Z0/reviews/ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfM0lYdXVBRRAB","relativePublishTimeDescription":"3 weeks ago","rating":5,"text":{"text":"The blackened salmon Caesar is top notch and the bartenders are awesome","languageCode":"en"},"originalText":{"text":"The blackened salmon Caesar is top notch and the bartenders are awesome","languageCode":"en"},"authorAttribution":{"displayName":"Michael Phillips","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114096323891054452143/reviews","photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWSK4PRyEYwcUacSC1KcsUj_YK2Ozc6vav8KPIWvM2CfrvJOh_6mg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5"},"publishTime":"2025-01-13T23:58:45.980273Z","flagContentUri":"https://www.google.com/local/review/rap/report?postId=ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfM0lYdXVBRRAB&d=17924085&t=1","googleMapsUri":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m6!14m5!1m4!2m3!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfM0lYdXVBRRAB!2m1!1s0x8834f1577bf7456b:0x9dd5d689a638f46d"}]},{"id":"ChIJKVM6e5jxNIgRq4AgLmEmbEc","types":["bar","point_of_interest","establishment"],"internationalPhoneNumber":"+1 412-281-2900","formattedAddress":"745 Grant St, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA","location":{"latitude":40.4430206,"longitude":-79.99505769999999},"rating":3.6,"websiteUri":"https://www.druryhotels.com/locations/pittsburgh-pa/drury-plaza-hotel-pittsburgh-downtown?utm_campaign=gmb&utm_medium=organic&utm_source=local","priceLevel":"PRICE_LEVEL_MODERATE","userRatingCount":8,"displayName":{"text":"4th District","languageCode":"en"},"takeout":true,"dineIn":true,"currentOpeningHours":{"openNow":true,"periods":[{"open":{"day":0,"hour":17,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":9}},"close":{"day":0,"hour":23,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":9}}},{"open":{"day":1,"hour":17,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":10}},"close":{"day":2,"hour":0,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":11}}},{"open":{"day":2,"hour":17,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":11}},"close":{"day":3,"hour":0,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":12}}},{"open":{"day":3,"hour":17,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":12}},"close":{"day":4,"hour":0,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":13}}},{"open":{"day":4,"hour":17,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":13}},"close":{"day":4,"hour":23,"minute":59,"truncated":true,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":13}}},{"open":{"day":5,"hour":17,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":7}},"close":{"day":6,"hour":0,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":8}}},{"open":{"day":6,"hour":17,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":8}},"close":{"day":0,"hour":0,"minute":0,"date":{"year":2025,"month":2,"day":9}}}],"weekdayDescriptions":["Monday: 5:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Tuesday: 5:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Wednesday: 5:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Thursday: 5:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Friday: 5:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Saturday: 5:00 PM – 12:00 AM","Sunday: 5:00 – 11:00 PM"],"nextCloseTime":"2025-02-08T05:00:00Z"},"reviews":[{"name":"places/ChIJKVM6e5jxNIgRq4AgLmEmbEc/reviews/ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkMmRtZmd3RRAB","relativePublishTimeDescription":"11 months ago","rating":2,"text":{"text":"Mediocre service and overpriced food.

They both are owned by the same company but their menus are different. Be sure to check which one you want to visit beforehand.\n\nHere is the summary of our visit:\n\n1) Ambiance 5/5: It has a cute cafe vibe with chic and delightful decor. Additionally, it also has cute flowery seating outside which would be great for an evening date or friends get together. The place has seating in front of the service desk or you can choose to go inside where they also have a bar and seating area. Also, they have QR codes for their menu\n\n2) Service 6/5: This is where I would like to highlight Taylor Ann G's service. She was of amazing help to us. She helped us with all the suggestions and side options. I am allergic to fish and so was she. So she helped me choose a great spicy dish with great side options which I loved. I also do not eat beef. She let us know that chicken might be made on the same grill and helped us with informing the chef to make it separately in a pan. The service was quick too and we received our order within 10 minutes.\n\nOne additional thing for people to know is that they add a service fee for takeout orders which was promptly informed to us by Taylor and she said we don't have to tip since that takes care of it.\n\n3) Food 4/5: This is what was a hit and a miss for us. We had to catch a flight and we took a take away so we are giving it the benefit of the doubt but here is the summary of what we ordered:\n\na) Yum Yum chicken: This was what my wife ordered and I tried it at the airport. The chicken was chewy and not good at all. It felt like frozen chicken which was baked in an oven and tossed in a sauce. The purple rice was good though. The portion was good too.\n\nb) Spicy Fire chicken: I really loved it. This was like a bento box with chicken. purple rice with sesame seeds, tender green salad, and some radish side (which was amazing, and took it based on Taylor's suggestion). The portion was good for one. The dish was not really spicy and tasted more like buffalo sauce chicken.\n\n4) Value for money 4/5: It was not the cheapest place and it would have been value for money if we ate it there since the place looks great. The price is good for the portion but it would be great if it was a tad less.\n\nOverall, I am definitely going to visit this place when I am in town for the ambiance, service, and proximity to downtown and so much of Pittsburgh's history.\n\nThe great:\n\n1) Taylor's friendliness and service\n2) Spicy fire chicken\n3) Ambiance\n\nNot so good:\n\n1) Yum Yum chicken","languageCode":"en"},"originalText":{"text":"We visited this cute little Korean place on our last visit to Pittsburgh downtown.

The price is good for the portion but it would be great if it was a tad less.\n\nOverall, I am definitely going to visit this place when I am in town for the ambiance, service, and proximity to downtown and so much of Pittsburgh's history.\n\nThe great:\n\n1) Taylor's friendliness and service\n2) Spicy fire chicken\n3) Ambiance\n\nNot so good:\n\n1) Yum Yum chicken","languageCode":"en"},"authorAttribution":{"displayName":"sunny shandilya","uri":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116939268108407194871/reviews","photoUri":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVzed0wYSK8z0Crc_ais5qni9UMA0OqFHRSf_Cl4PIdJVUbT28h=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6"},"publishTime":"2024-09-23T01:11:15.505449Z","flagContentUri":"https://www.google.com/local/review/rap/report?postId=ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNucElQUGl3RRAB&d=17924085&t=1","googleMapsUri":"https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m6!14m5!1m4!2m3!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNucElQUGl3RRAB!2m1!1s0x8834f1580caacfa5:0x8bcbc3b2c9e81a4b"},{"name":"places/ChIJpc-qDFjxNIgRSxroybLDy4s/reviews/ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzcTdYSUxBEAE","relativePublishTimeDescription":"2 months ago","rating":5,"text":{"text":"My son and I stopped earlier to eat and we were not disappointed!
