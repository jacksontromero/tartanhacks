Free coffee in the downstairs lobby.\n\nThe front desk staff are so friendly and helpful (a big thank you to  Abby and Holly!!).\n\nThe room is open and spacious with a sofa, microwave, fridge and TV. We always get a king size bed....very comfortable. The bathroom has a massive shower. A hairdryer is provided as are all the toiletries you need. My husband says it is pretty much perfect!\n\nThe complimentary breakfast is really good...fruit, waffles, bacon, omelettes,  juices - all the good stuff you would expect.\n\nThe location is fantastic. You can walk anywhere downtown very easily. We love the strip district which is a couple of hundred yards away with its great food stops.  Also, a must visit is a monthly vintage market during season. A lovely walking path along the river front is about 100 yards away that takes you all the way to  Point State Park where the rivers meet.\n\nYou can easily walk across the river to the football and baseball stadiums and to the Andy Warhol museum. The Heinz History museum is directly across the street from the hotel.\n\nIf you want to bring your dogs or cats this is the place for you!  For a flat fee of $75 per stay you can bring 2 cats or dogs.\n\nMake your reservation soon. You will not be disappointed.",

I booked this room due to great experiences with Cambria in Ohio and it is right beside the Arena. Since the concert was canceled they did allow me to cancel my room. However, the problem I'm having is that you have to get a ticket upon arrival for parking. When I exited the parking area it had me scan the ticket to get out and it wanted me to pay $50.00. I couldn't back up because there were multiple cars behind me due to others leaving I'm assuming due to the canceled concert. I called into the hotel to see if they could do something and was put on hold. So I went ahead and paid the $50.00 so that I could exit and not keep others waiting. The next morning I tried calling into the hotel and couldn't reach anyone. I have sent two detailed emails with attachments that have gone unanswered. I even reached out to Choice Hotels and received a very nice response that they each location is individually owned but that they tried reaching out to this location on my behalf and was unable to reach anyone as well. So it looks like I paid $50.00 to park my car, go inside and learn the concert was canceled, go back out to my car and leave.",

        "text": "So overall the experience was fine. The hotel is located downtown close to the cultural center and restaurants. However, during my stay the hotel unauthorized an additional payment a day after I checked in. When I informed the staff that my card was charged an additional $700 I was informed \"oh sorry that was the computer night audit.  That happens when guests' card are charged extra because their card is on file\". SMH WHAT?! That was the only reason for the charge, no parking costs, no room services, no incidentals (we still had 4 more days of our stay). There was no reason for the extra charge provided outside \"our computer did it\".  This offset the balance in my baking account and I reported the charge as fraud to my bank and turned off my card.\nI'm curious to know how often Marriott does this to their guests,  especially since the staff seemed to be used to this happening?! Presents as untrustworthy",

The rooms didn't have any USB ports, and only some had renovated bathrooms. (One of the rooms they offered me did not. Fortunately, mind did.) Even though I was on 18th floor, you could hear some road noise. The windows need to be serviced or replaced, among many other things.\nThe Concierge Lounge was very small for this size property, and cleared out of any staff or desserts at 940pm when I arrived. Both are supposed to be there until 10pm.\nThe valet parking is way overpriced ($40), and provides limited service - they are only there from 7am-10pm, so they are of limited use. At that price, they should be available 24/7 like at other hotels, and perhaps even wash the car for you. So you don't really need them .\nYou also have to pay the parking vendor the $40 up front. It is unaffiliated with the hotel and cannot be billed on your room folio. Ridiculous.\nThey did not have my guaranteed room type (king), and while I was solo, so it wasn't a huge deal, it could have been less than ideal.\nMy Marriott status was not acknowledged and certainly not appreciated with the proper room type at check-in.\nAlso, I was in 1817 and the guy in 1818 was on speaker phone and I could hear everything quite loudly, both from my room and the corridor.\nOn a positive note, the location was excellent for me because I was going to PPG Paints Arena.\nRachel and her male colleague on the evening shift, and the night auditor, were super nice. (Not quite the case with the woman who checked me in.)\nTHIS HOTEL NEEDS A TOTAL RENOVATION ASAP!!!",

Also in the second room i faced the same issue with the AC. I kept calling guest service who called the maintenance guy to repair the AC. To be fair the response time was fast. But never the less, guest should not face such issue.\n\nBreakfast is a menu order. Buffet in the week end only.\n\nPrice is bit high. I recommend you download the marriott app for better deals.\n\nOverall, fair experience",

In the room, my alarm was set to ring at 6:00am and I couldn't fall back to sleep afterwards. When I tried to shower, the handle was loose so each time I tried to adjust the temperature, the handle would fall down due to gravity. I had to choose between a cold shower or a scolding hot one. It was awful. THEN, when I checked out and tried to explain to the girl who was working (December 21 at 12:09pm), she was rude. She never once looked up from her computer, didn't make eye contact once, didn't thank me for staying, etc. When I was telling her about the alarm, she never looked up from her computer, didn't apologize for the inconvenience - nothing. I felt like I was bothering her. When I tried to explain the shower and she refused to look at me, I said that you're not even looking at me and her response was 'I can hear you'. I said never mind and walked off. She should NOT be working with the public if she couldn't care less about her job. An apology is the least the hotel could do. According to other reviews, rudeness from staff has been reported and the owner explained that it was a 'teachable moment' and it was an 'isolated incident'. Couldn't be further from the truth.",

I travel all of the time and never use this credit unless I am told I can use it at the snack market.  Bad customer service.\nAs others have mentioned the rooms could use an update as they are pretty run down but they are by no means unlivable.\nThe location is fantastic for PPG arena and walking pretty much anywhere downtown\n3 stars for customer service and the need to start updating the rooms",

After parking, we went out to our vehicle to find all compartment lids open and things strewn out of them, as well as, glovebox wide open.  Items stolen.  Explanation we were told by the valet staff manager, is that the new lock boxes they use to store the car keys in are so close to the door handles that if someone tries to open the doors it will automatically unlock.   The box hangs on the car window. Huge security issue, right?!?!!!   So why are they still using if the area is not surveil-lanced and  making sure the one entrance garage is monitored?!????!  When this was brought to their attention, the valet manager, showed us a sign that read, not responsible for lost or damaged items, etc. This place is a joke!!!  The room is much to be desired. From cosmetic appeal to needing fresh coat of paint. Toilet ran water all the time, shower dripped water.  Close and convenient to the Lawrence Convention Center, but not the best area.  Would not recommend to anyone!!!!",

Both Saturday and Sunday mornings from about 7-10a there was a near continuous extremely loud banging from below - some sort of mechanical or loading dock sound maybe?\nValet cost should be included in this expensive of a rate.\nExcellent location for Pitt visit and access to restaurants.\nNo where near worth $500/night.\nI have stayed at 5 different hotels in this area and will not return to this one.

I suspect they are curating other negative reviews,\n\nFirst, we arrived after dark and the neighborhood is not the best.  I could overlook this but I was in town for work and brought my wife along—now I have to worry about her safety if she ventures out on foot. Not that there is much in the vicinity… the walk downtown involves going  under several highway overpasses, sort of a concrete tunnel feel that even makes me a bit nervous.\n\nThe front desk clerk was not very friendly.  He checked us in quickly but it wasn't very welcoming…not a big deal to me except all the online reviews tall up the great staff and how warm and welcoming everyone is—-definitely did not get that vibe.\n\nThe room itself was on the small side.  The bathroom was quite small by modern standards and the shower is downright claustrophobic.  The room was hot and despite adjusting the hvac controls we could not get the room temperature to change.  On the plus side things seemed clean.  The mattress clearly had some age to it but it wasn't horrible.\n\nOverall I feel hoodwinked by the positive reviews on this place.  It's a 3 at best so please beware and act accordingly.",

I now have an additional $150 USD on my card that I have to hope and trust will be refunded in the next two weeks.

        "text": "I have lived at Oak Hill for 3 months. I have had the hot water go out no less than 5 times. This most recent time I haven’t even heard anything back from the maintenance team. The maintenance team that, mind you, doesn’t even have the keys to ACCESS my water heater. I have left voicemails, sent emails, and this issue hasn’t been taken care of. The maintenance team is by definition incompetent, as they literally do not have access to the system they’re meant to repair and the few lucky times they had access they told me they don’t know how to fix it and called an outside contractor.\n\nThe manager, Evan, will of course send you a token email and then provide no updates whatsoever on the situation. Mind you, the hot water was already out earlier this year for over a week. I have never had this issue with any other rental and have never had this poor a service experience in all my life.\n\nThis is a great neighborhood, these are beautiful apartments, but I can’t recommend you live here because management has allowed my unit to become uninhabitable over 6 times within 90 days. I attached screenshots to show the sheer number of service requests I’ve had to put in. It’s so bad I literally can’t make this up.\n\nDon’t rent here until they can handle what everyone else I’ve ever rented from has been able to for less money.",

Also, a friendly welcome upon entering, the center certainly has a welcoming feeling.\n\nMy overall impression was this was a museum about Pittsburgh…so if you really wanted to learn about Pittsburgh this was fine.\n\nI was mostly interested in the Heinz factory and history, and Mr Rogers.  I kinda felt the Center could have had more info on Heinz.  Compared to Hershey where you really get a sense of the “how” and the entire process, the Heinz center didn’t really get after that.  At a superficial level it was fine…wish they had some sampling as well.\n\nThe sports exhibits were really cool, Pittsburgh has some incredible sports history.\n\nOverall, yes I recommend…it’s. A great museum and depending on your tastes and interests could very well be 5 star experience.",

My husband had a spicy margarita that was very spicy but well balanced with the cucumber. The conch fritters were so shockingly good! I wouldn't have expected a restaurant on the strip in pittsburgh to have such good ones. The cuban was good, not the best we've had, but still really good. It could have used more pickle and more meat. The only thing we would change is the fries, I'm not sure if it was an off night, but they were really crunchy and little flavor. Also, the tables are just really close together, so it was hard to talk and not listen to the tables next to us, I think most nights it would be fine, we just had a loud couple with interesting stories next to us.

It was a Monday night, and yet the restaurant was fully booked and we had to sit at the bar to order food, which tells me that they are pretty popular with the Diners. The theme is supposed to be Caribbean, but I found the menu to be overall American and Caribbean plus Mexican. We started with the queso and chips. Originally it comes with chorizo, but since I had a vegetarian Friend, we asked for the chorizo to be removed, and they were pretty gracious to do that. The dip itself was great, but the chips felt like they were bought from trader Joe’s. My friend had cocktails as well and they liked it. For our entres, I got the jerk chicken, which seems to be one of the specialities. My other friend got a jerk chicken sandwich, and another friend got the vegetarian sandwich. They liked the dishes. By half chicken came with a side of avocados and tomatoes, and other stuff, and it was pretty salady. The chicken itself was extremely well cooked and extremely choosy. However, the jerk flavour could have been a little more amplified. Overall not a bad dish. However, none of the dishes were memorable for me, and I don’t know if I’ll be back here again for dinner.",

She survived a 12+ hour surgery and suffered many other unrelated set backs on her journey to get home. I told Dr. Gardner I wanted to do one of those UPMC commercials.

He made a plan in the best interest of my baby & I that put me at complete peace. He checked on me the evening of my surgery after completing several surgeries to make sure the miscommunciation with nursing staff about my pain medication was sorted out. He removed my entire \"giant\" tumor after another hospital said they'd probably have to leave some of it behind.  I just returned from my 3 month post-op appointment and I feel fabulous. I would recommend Dr. Gardner to ANYONE without ANY hesitation.\n\nI honestly believe the decision to get a second opinion and switch surgeons changed the trajectory of my health for the rest of my life.",

        "text": "It’s hard to find words to express my huge gratitude! The bottom line: Dr. Okonkwo GAVE ME MY LIFE BACK!!! That’s not a cliché - it’s fact. He is a brilliant and exceptional neurosurgeon, at the forefront of advancements in his field, who focused on me, his patient, and planned and performed the spinal surgery that he determined would bring me from disability to mobility. He and his team worked together on my case: the evaluations were extensive and thorough, and the compassion was heart-felt. My history and symptoms were paramount, plus test results were carefully reviewed. All of the staff is top-notch! A special shout-out to the amazing PAs: Alycia, Danielle, and Lauren. They do much of the intake and follow-up, and know exactly what to look for - most importantly, pertinent information they need to pass on to Dr. Okonkwo. Yes, when the time comes for the doctor himself to see you, he may have a packed day (emergencies, critical patients) and perhaps be running late.…so definitely be ready for it (block extra time off, and bring snacks just in case ;)). That being said, the majority of my appointments were right on time. Just remember that we are all in this together, and his office is patient-driven! When Dr. Okonkwo walks in the room, he looks you in the eye and tells you the most important things you need to know, and doesn’t gloss over your condition. He’s razor sharp, personable, compassionate, focused, and doesn’t waste time, plus he usually has a laugh to lighten things up. If you feel that you didn’t get enough information, simply ask! :) On the day of my 6-hour surgery, I felt nothing but total TRUST in Dr. O, and that’s not a sentiment that comes easily to me. The surgery was wonderfully successful (spinal fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1 via ALIF with posterior instrumentation on 58-year-old female), and I will always be grateful each and every day, and THANK GOD, for this gifted and dedicated surgeon! Dr. David O. Okonkwo is a TREASURE!",

        "text": "I would not have taken the time to write this review if it was not for the extremely Rude scheduler behind the cubicles in this office. First of all, I brought my mom in for her appointment at 9:00a.m. Office empty, no one at the check in window. Why would there be? They were all down the hall gabbing and chitty chatting. Must be the \"opening Coffee Break\". Anyways, we got through the appointment which was a tad strange for we had a 9:00am appointment and we were still waiting at 9:30 and there were no other patients in the office. Again, must have been the gathering of the minds over coffee. We came up after the appointment to the check out window and again, no one there. My mother had to call out \"is anybody here\"? waited so long had to take a picture of here waiting. Finally, well, maybe not, a woman popped out from behind a cubicle and came up to our area. Now, I reached into my pocket for my phone and habitually brought my \"vape\" out with it and all of a sudden this woman rips into me like the gestapo about my vape pen and \"orders\" me as if I am some kind of child to \"put it away now!\" Eyes pierced and seemingly ready for an argument. Young lady, I think you need to worry about your boss taking drugs more than a vape pen that pokes out of a clients pocket. Secondly, you were also a part of the chat sessions down the hall when clients were waiting at the window. A bunch of clowns! Teach your people customer service, courtesy, diplomacy, kindness and respect for their elders. Maybe you should teach then how to treat people, how to talk to them, speak to them. Its no wonder the office was empty. Your doctor already got demoted why not try helping him out with some decent respectable employees? Sounds like its time for a few seminars to me.",

I told Dr McGrath’s office that she here problem needs addressed right away and was told that they couldn’t do that.

From everything I read Dr McGrath seems to be very good and it’s a shame that this person won’t do what needs to be done to get us in to see him.",

Dr Moossy ordered a FCE that had nothing to do with my job and when I passed it lied on an office note from my next visit to make it sound like I was trying to get out of going back to work. He sent that to my insurance company so they cut off my disability pay and health insurance.  The whole time I was told this was a 2 to 2 and a half year recovery and now only a year and a half in and they expect it to be better when it’s not.  I was lied to again today because Dr Moossy had said his secretary would write me a letter to get my disability and insurance turned back on but when Kathy called to see what I needed she said no I’m not writing you anything because you just don’t want to go back to work your fce is fine.  I said I explained everything to the Dr this morning and he said you would do this for me and she said no he didn’t say that because I just talked to him and he told me absolutely do not write him a letter because he’s fine.  Now I have no disability pay and no health insurance and I’m 2 weeks from being fired from my job of 25 years because I’m still not able to go back but dr moossy told the insurance company I was based on a test that had nothing to do with my job.  If you can find a different doctor to do what you are there to see Dr Moossy for go to a different doctor because they are completely unwilling to help you out at this office and are rude and insulting while telling you they aren’t going to help you.",
